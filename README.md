# OpenComputers_NTM_Integration
In this repo, you'll find all the .lua files needed for the project. You can load them directly in the mod by doing "winget https:\\github.ecc...".

I'm trying (me, FirePhoenix), to make a "fully" automated work, with OpenComputers and NTM.
My goal is to make a lot of things funcional, like shooting missles, using reactors, but all of this, via PC!

I know it sounds crazy, or some things even useless, since they don't even need a script or anything else, but who cares!?

I like coding? Yes.

I like Minecraft and these 2 mods in particular? Yes.

If you find it interisting, try it yourself, and let me know what do you think, or even make upgrades, or everything possible!

If you like this project, please consider supporting it by, maybe just writing a comment? :)

I know it's a useless thing too, but for me it's very important to know what you think. And maybe this is not even a real description or README for my repo.

Nevermind, enjoy!

Edit: To use these scripts, you MUST have Minecraft, NTM, OC and all the other stuff in MC version 1.7.10. I just discovered that with the 1.12.2 version, OC and NTM can't communicate with most of the blocks. Full compatibility is in 1.7.10.
